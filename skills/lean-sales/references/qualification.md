## 1. Four Key Decision Areas

### 1.1 Is This Opportunity FOR the Customer?
**Purpose**: Determine if the solution addresses actual customer needs and pain points.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Does the customer experience the problem we solve?
- Have they articulated the pain point?
- Is the problem currently impacting their business?
- Do they recognize the cost of the problem?

**Scoring Window**: 0-25 points

---

### 1.2 Will They ACT on a Solution?
**Purpose**: Assess customer motivation and readiness for change.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Has budget been allocated or approved?
- Do they have decision authority or access to it?
- Is there timeline pressure driving urgency?
- Are they actively exploring solutions (not just browsing)?
- Do they have organizational buy-in?

**Scoring Window**: 0-25 points

---

### 1.3 Is This a Good FIT for Both Parties?
**Purpose**: Confirm alignment between customer requirements and solution capabilities.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- Does our solution match their specific requirements?
- Are we the right-fit vendor (not overbuilding or underbuilding)?
- Can we deliver within their constraints (timeline, budget, integration)?
- Will this generate acceptable value and ROI for them?
- Are there any compatibility red flags?

**Scoring Window**: 0-25 points

---

### 1.4 Can WE WIN This Deal?
**Purpose**: Evaluate competitive position and implementation feasibility.

**Evaluation Focus**:
- What is our competitive standing?
- Are key stakeholders supportive of our solution?
- Do we have access to decision-makers?
- What is the quality of our relationship vs. competitors?
- Can we execute and deliver successfully?

**Scoring Window**: 0-25 points

**Total Qualification Score Range**: 0-100 points

## 3. Scoring Methodology

### Scoring Framework

Each question is worth points based on answer selection. Sum all points within each Decision Area to derive subtotal. Multiply subtotal by 1.0 (no weighting applied initially).

#### Scoring Guide by Answer Selection:

**Strongest Answers** (Typically 8-10 points per question):
- Direct alignment with stated criteria
- Quantified data provided
- Clear positive indicator

**Strong Answers** (Typically 5-7 points per question):
- General alignment with criteria
- Some quantification or confirmation
- Positive indicator with minor gaps

**Moderate Answers** (Typically 2-4 points per question):
- Partial alignment with criteria
- Exploratory or uncertain response
- Mixed indicator

**Weak Answers** (Typically 0-1 points per question):
- Misalignment with criteria
- No confirmation or data
- Negative indicator

### Calculation Example:

```
FOR Decision Area (Max 25):
  Q1 (Articulated problem): 9 points
  Q2 (Current impact): 8 points
  Q3 (Previous attempts): 6 points
  Q4 (Problem cost): 8 points
  Subtotal FOR = 31 points → Capped at 25

ACT Decision Area (Max 25):
  Q5 (Budget allocated): 8 points
  Q6 (Decision access): 7 points
  Q7 (Timeline urgency): 9 points
  Q8 (Implementation timeline): 8 points
  Subtotal ACT = 32 points → Capped at 25

FIT Decision Area (Max 25):
  Q9 (Solution match): 8 points
  Q10 (Price alignment): 6 points
  Q11 (Implementation feasible): 7 points
  Q12 (ROI clarity): 8 points
  Subtotal FIT = 29 points → Capped at 25

WIN Decision Area (Max 25):
  Q13 (Competitive position): 7 points
  Q14 (Relationship strength): 8 points
  Q15 (Competitive advantage): 9 points
  Q16 (Delivery confidence): 8 points
  Subtotal WIN = 32 points → Capped at 25

TOTAL QUALIFICATION SCORE = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100
```

### Score Interpretation:

- **80-100**: Highly Qualified - Pursue aggressively
- **60-79**: Qualified - Proceed with standard engagement
- **40-59**: Partially Qualified - Requires qualification work
- **Below 40**: Not Qualified - Consider walking away

---

## 4. Deal-Breaker Criteria (When to Walk Away)

### Critical Disqualifiers:

**FOR Decision Area Deal-Breakers**:
- [ ] No identified problem or stated pain point
- [ ] Customer acknowledges problem but shows no intent to solve
- [ ] Problem is outside our solution domain entirely

**ACT Decision Area Deal-Breakers**:
- [ ] No budget exists and none will be approved
- [ ] No decision authority accessible; blocked at gatekeeper level
- [ ] Timeline is 18+ months out; too early to engage meaningfully

**FIT Decision Area Deal-Breakers**:
- [ ] Core requirement mismatch; our solution cannot meet it
- [ ] Customer requirements demand custom build beyond scope/cost
- [ ] Technology incompatibility or integration impossible
- [ ] Total cost of implementation exceeds customer lifetime value

**WIN Decision Area Deal-Breakers**:
- [ ] Customer already selected competitor with signed contract
- [ ] Key stakeholder has veto power and is opposed
- [ ] We lack capability or resources to deliver; high failure risk
- [ ] Customer requires references we cannot provide (specific industry/company size)

### Walking Away Decision:
If ANY critical disqualifier exists, move opportunity to "Do Not Pursue" status. Re-engage only if disqualifier is explicitly resolved.

## 6. No-Go Decision Framework

### No-Go Triggers:

**STOP** pursuing if any of these conditions exist:

1. **No Identified Champion**
   - After 3+ interactions, no advocate has emerged
   - All conversations are with gatekeepers or end-users only
   - Customer communication delays exceed 2 weeks consistently

2. **Unresolvable Requirements Mismatch**
   - 3+ critical requirements cannot be met by our solution
   - Customer demands custom development; cost > 30% of deal value
   - Technical integration is not feasible without major product changes

3. **Budget Reality Fails**
   - Customer states "no budget" and won't commit to approval timeline
   - Requested scope exceeds available budget by >50%
   - Budget approval is tied to condition we cannot control

4. **Decision Process Indefinite**
   - No defined decision timeline provided after 2+ meetings
   - Customer cannot articulate how/when decision will be made
   - Decision process keeps shifting or expanding

5. **Competitive Position Hopeless**
   - Competitor already has contract and implementation underway
   - Customer explicitly states competitor is preferred
   - We have lost 2+ competitive evaluations to same competitor

6. **Delivery Risk Too High**
   - Customer has failed implementation with similar solutions
   - We lack proven capability for their specific use case
   - Project scope or timeline incompatible with our delivery model

### No-Go Documentation:
- Record reason(s) for no-go decision
- Set review date to re-engage (if applicable)
- Update CRM to "Do Not Pursue" with clear notes
- Share learning with team to avoid similar situations

---

## 7. Data Collection Approach During Customer Interactions

### When to Collect:
- **Initial Discovery**: Gather FOR/ACT baseline data
- **Second Meeting**: Validate FOR; deepen ACT/FIT exploration
- **Third Meeting**: Confirm all four areas; begin detailed scoring
- **Ongoing**: Update scorecard as new information emerges

### Data Collection Best Practices:

**Ask, Don't Assume**:
- "What specific business outcome would solving this deliver?"
- "When does this need to be resolved by?"
- "Who makes the final decision on vendor selection?"
- "What is your budget range for this initiative?"

**Listen for Voluntary Information**:
- Customer unprompted mentions budget, timeline, or authority
- Customer references past implementations (success/failure)
- Customer compares to specific competitors

**Qualify Before Pushing**:
- Confirm budget exists before proposing solution
- Understand timeline before committing implementation plan
- Identify champion before requesting executive meeting

**Document Everything**:
- Record customer's own words (quotes) in CRM notes
- Capture dates of key statements
- Note source of information (direct customer quote vs. assumption)
- Flag areas of uncertainty for follow-up

### CRM Data Fields:

```
FOR Area:
  - Problem Statement (customer's words)
  - Annual Impact (quantified if provided)
  - Previous Solutions (what they've tried)

ACT Area:
  - Budget Status (approved/pending/unknown)
  - Decision Authority (name, title, access level)
  - Timeline (specific date or window)
  - Internal Drivers (why now?)

FIT Area:
  - Key Requirements (list)
  - Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves
  - Price Range/Budget
  - Implementation Constraints

WIN Area:
  - Competitive Status (vendors in eval)
  - Relationship Strength (by stakeholder)
  - Our Strengths in Their Context
  - Our Weaknesses vs. Competition
```
