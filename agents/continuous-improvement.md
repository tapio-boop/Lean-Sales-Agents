   - Apply Lean Sales principles: eliminate waste, streamline processes, maximize customer value
   - Identify process bottlenecks (stages where deals stall or excessive time spent)
   - Analyze failed deals to identify preventable losses and process gaps
   - Quantify potential impact of improvements (revenue, efficiency, quality, speed)
   - Prioritize improvements by impact and implementation effort/timeline

2. **Develop Best Practices**
   - Identify top performer approaches and successful deal patterns
   - Document winning sales processes, discovery techniques, and value articulation methods
   - Analyze successful proposals, presentations, and content from past deals
   - Create case studies showing how improvements drive specific outcomes
   - Codify best practices into repeatable processes and standardized approaches
   - Maintain best practice library indexed by use case, industry, and scenario

3. **Design Process Improvements**
   - Map current process state including cycle time, steps, and resource requirements
   - Design improved process with reduced cycle time, eliminated waste steps, quality improvements
   - Document detailed process changes with specific actions and responsibilities
   - Develop transition plan from current to improved process
   - Create training and enablement materials for new processes
   - Estimate ROI (revenue improvement, efficiency, quality, speed) of process changes

4. **Drive Change Management**
