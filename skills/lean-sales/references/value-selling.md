# Value-Selling Reference Document

## 1. Two Forms of Value

### Output Value (Quantitative)
Measurable business outcomes directly tied to revenue, cost reduction, or efficiency gains.
- **Definition**: Tangible financial impact (revenue increase, cost decrease, efficiency gains)
- **Measurement**: Dollar amounts, percentages, time savings
- **Examples**: Increased sales revenue, reduced operational costs, labor hours saved
- **Stakeholder Appeal**: Economic buyers, CFOs, procurement
- **Template**: `Output Value = (Baseline Metric - Improved Metric) × Unit Cost`

### Process Value (Qualitative)
Non-financial improvements to workflows, user experience, or organizational capability.
- **Definition**: Intangible benefits (improved decision-making, reduced risk, better visibility)
- **Measurement**: Capability improvements, risk reduction, user satisfaction scores
- **Examples**: Better data visibility, improved compliance, faster decision cycles, reduced risk
- **Stakeholder Appeal**: End users, operations leaders, clinical staff
- **Template**: `Process Value = Current Pain Point Severity × Coverage Percentage`

## 2. Value Proposition Development (4-Step Process)

### Step 1: Diagnose Current State
Document the baseline and associated pain points.

**Template:**
```
Current State Analysis
├─ Baseline Metric: [metric name/value]
├─ Frequency of Problem: [daily/weekly/monthly]
├─ Cost Per Occurrence: $[amount] or [hours]
├─ Total Annual Impact: $[amount] or [hours]
└─ Root Cause: [process, system, or capability gap]
```

### Step 2: Define Future State
Specify the desired outcome with measurable targets.

**Template:**
```
Future State Definition
├─ Target Metric: [metric name]
├─ Improvement Target: [% or amount]
├─ Timeline to Achievement: [months]
├─ Required Conditions: [dependencies, resources]
└─ Success Criteria: [measurable checkpoints]
```

### Step 3: Quantify the Gap
Calculate financial and process value between states.

**Template:**
```
Value Quantification
├─ Output Value: $[annual savings/revenue]
├─ Process Value: [capability/risk/quality improvements]
├─ One-Time Costs: $[implementation, training]
├─ Ongoing Costs: $[annual maintenance, licenses]
└─ ROI %: [(Output Value - Ongoing Costs) / One-Time Costs] × 100
```

### Step 4: Build Buyer-Centric Narrative
Create role-specific value messaging.

**Template:**
```
Value Narrative [by Stakeholder Role]
├─ Economic Buyer: [financial impact and ROI]
├─ User/End User: [efficiency and experience gains]
├─ Technical/IT: [integration, security, compliance]
└─ Clinical/Domain Expert: [quality, safety, outcomes]
```

## 3. ROI Calculation Templates

### Basic ROI Formula
```
ROI (%) = (Annual Benefit - Annual Costs) / Implementation Cost × 100
Payback Period (months) = Implementation Cost / (Annual Benefit - Annual Costs) × 12
```

### Template: Full ROI Analysis
```
ROI Calculation Worksheet
├─ Implementation Cost: $[one-time]
├─ Year 1 Benefits: $[quantified value]
├─ Year 1 Ongoing Costs: $[annual expenses]

├─ Year 1 ROI: [%]
├─ Payback Period: [months]
├─ 3-Year Cumulative ROI: [%]
└─ NPV (discounted at 10%): $[amount]
```

### Sensitivity Analysis
Adjust key variables to show ROI under different scenarios.

**Template:**
```
Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic
└─ Assumption variance: [±20% to ±50%]
└─ ROI range: [low%] to [high%]
```

## 8. Financial Value Quantification Examples

### Example 1: Labor Efficiency Gain
```
SCENARIO: Claims Processing Automation

Current State
├─ Process: Manual claim review (8 hours per claim)
├─ Volume: 500 claims/month
├─ Labor cost: $50/hour fully-loaded
└─ Monthly cost: 500 × 8 hours × $50 = $200,000/month

Proposed Solution
├─ Process: Automated workflow with 1-hour manual review for exceptions
├─ Volume: 500 claims/month (90% automated end-to-end)
├─ Labor required: 450 × 1 hour + 50 × 8 hours = 850 hours/month
├─ Monthly cost: 850 × $50 = $42,500/month
├─ Monthly Savings: $200,000 - $42,500 = $157,500

Investment & ROI
├─ Implementation: $500,000
├─ Annual license: $120,000
├─ Annual savings: $157,500 × 12 = $1,890,000
├─ Annual net benefit: $1,890,000 - $120,000 = $1,770,000
├─ ROI: ($1,770,000 / $500,000) × 100 = 354%
└─ Payback: 3.4 months
```

### Example 2: Revenue Expansion
```
SCENARIO: Sales Pipeline Acceleration

Current State
├─ Sales cycle: 90 days
├─ Average deal size: $250,000
├─ Monthly deals closed: 2
├─ Monthly revenue: $500,000/month

Proposed Solution (Faster Deal Progression)
├─ Sales cycle: 60 days (30% faster)
├─ Pipeline acceleration effect: Deals complete 1 month earlier
├─ Additional deals in flight: 3 extra deals/month in accelerated pipeline
├─ Monthly revenue impact: Additional 1 deal/month × $250,000 = $250,000

Investment & ROI
├─ Implementation: $250,000
├─ Annual license: $60,000
├─ Additional annual revenue: $250,000 × 12 = $3,000,000
├─ Annual gross profit (assume 40%): $1,200,000
├─ Annual net benefit: $1,200,000 - $60,000 = $1,140,000
├─ ROI: ($1,140,000 / $250,000) × 100 = 456%
└─ Payback: 2.6 months
```

### Example 3: Risk Mitigation / Compliance
```
SCENARIO: Audit & Compliance Automation

Current State
├─ Annual audit prep cost: $200,000
├─ Compliance violations/fines (5-year average): $50,000/year
├─ Annual total cost: $250,000

Proposed Solution
├─ Automated audit trails & reporting: Reduces prep to $50,000
├─ Proactive compliance monitoring: Reduces violations by 80%
├─ Annual violations/fines: $10,000
├─ Annual total cost: $60,000
├─ Annual savings: $190,000

Investment & ROI
├─ Implementation: $300,000
├─ Annual license: $25,000
├─ Annual savings: $190,000
├─ Annual net benefit: $190,000 - $25,000 = $165,000
├─ ROI: ($165,000 / $300,000) × 100 = 55%
└─ Payback: 22 months
```
