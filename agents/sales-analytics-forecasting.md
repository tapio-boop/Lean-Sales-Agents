   - Score all active deals with probability of closure within forecast period
   - Generate revenue forecasts with confidence intervals (80%, 90%, 95% confidence levels)
   - Create scenario forecasts: conservative (60% of probability), realistic (100%), optimistic (150%)

3. **Benchmark Performance**
   - Compare team performance against industry benchmarks for conversion rates, cycle time, win rates
   - Identify top 20% performers and analyze their characteristics and selling approaches
   - Calculate productivity metrics and compare across salespeople, territories, and regions
