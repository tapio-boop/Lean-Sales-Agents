## 4. Discovery Question Frameworks by Stage

### Early Exploration
- "What brought us together today?" (open-ended start)
- "What's the current situation with [specific area]?"
- "How is this affecting your team/business?"
- "What have you tried so far?"

### Problem Deepening
- "Can you walk me through how this impacts [specific process]?"
- "What's the ripple effect across other teams?"
- "What would solving this enable you to do?"
- "What's preventing a solution today?"

### Impact Quantification
- "How much time/money does this cost annually?"
- "What's the cost of inaction?"
- "What would success look like in 6/12 months?"

### Buying Signal Exploration
- "What would the ideal solution include?"
- "What's your timeline for addressing this?"
- "Who else needs to weigh in on this decision?"

## 5. Needs Analysis Structure

### Latent Needs (Not Yet Articulated)
- Customer doesn't recognize the problem yet
- Discovery approach: Ask "what if" questions, share industry benchmarks
- Example: "We often see companies in your space struggling with X. Have you experienced this?"

### Articulated Needs (Explicitly Stated)
- Customer recognizes and voices the problem
- Discovery approach: Validate, explore root causes, quantify impact
- Example: "I hear you're struggling with X. Can we dig deeper into how this manifests?"

### Underlying Needs (Root Causes)
- The real driver beneath stated problems
- Discovery approach: Ask "why" iteratively (5 whys), explore consequences
- Example: "Why is that challenging? What makes it difficult?"

**Analysis Template:**
1. Surface Problem: [What they state]
2. Root Cause: [Why it happens]
3. Business Impact: [Quantified consequence]
4. Solution Vision: [What they need]

## 6. Engagement Point Identification

**Identify Natural Engagement Opportunities:**

- Where does their team interact with this problem daily?
- What regular meetings or processes touch this area?
- Who would be the natural champion/advocate?
- What initiatives or projects are currently active?

**Engagement Strategies:**
- Invite them to relevant insight sessions or webinars
- Share relevant case studies or research
- Offer a small, low-risk pilot or assessment
- Connect them with peers who faced similar challenges
- Provide benchmarking data for their industry
