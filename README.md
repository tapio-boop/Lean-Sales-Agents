## The Methodology

Based on **Lean Sales: More Sales with Less Selling** (2013), this system applies lean principles to B2B sales:

1. **Customer Value First** — Every action creates demonstrable value
2. **Align to Customer Journey** — Map to how customers decide, not how we sell
3. **Proactive Over Reactive** — Engage before RFPs (60% vs 20% win rates)
4. **Data-Driven Qualification** — Fact-based criteria, not intuition
5. **Eliminate Waste** — Focus only on winnable deals

## Qualification Framework

The 4-question test applied to every opportunity:

| Area | Question | Score |
|------|----------|-------|
| **FOR** | Is this an opportunity for the customer? | 0-25 |
| **ACT** | Will the customer take action? | 0-25 |
| **FIT** | Is this a good fit for us? | 0-25 |
| **WIN** | Can we win? | 0-25 |

**Total: 0-100**

- Below 40: No-go
- 40-59: Requires qualification work
- 60-79: Proceed with standard engagement
- 80-100: Pursue aggressively
